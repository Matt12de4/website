It's a different experience that kept me going for hours at a time. I have owned the game for multiple years now and never have I thought to myself that buying the game was a bad idea, heck I even bought a new headset multiple times to get a better and better experience every time I played.  I went from PSVR to Quest to Rift S to now CV1, I got all of these for Beat Saber and I personally don't regret it one bit and never have. If you have the chance, I would personally suggest you get this game it is one of my favorite games ever and I could get on at any time of day and feel great.</h4></td>

<td class="lefttext" width="225px"><h4>While it has to be said ‘Elixir’ is way too short for its own good while it is going it is a lot of fun, especially when you play the experience with hand tracking rather than the controllers. You play the role of a witches apprentice and have to perform various spells in the form of hand-motions. It looks good and is oddly immersive. But it won’t last you much more than 30 mins tops and that is if you mess about a lot and some people will argue it is hardly worth the download. I am not one of those people, but yes I do wish it had more content, but it is free and I say it’s well worth a look.</h4></td></table>
