Tears started to stream down my cheeks. I also received VRChat. I then whispered to myself, "This is the one..." My day couldn't get better at this point. I was so happy. I could hardly put on the Oculus without fainting!! But, when I did put it on, I entered a new world. I escaped reality. My day did get better. I made so many friends. I had an amazing time. I played all day!! I made sure to be in full concentration. </h4></td>

The amount of guns that have been added to this game are amazing, and the models of the guns are just fantastic, it feels like I’m holding a real gun! the only complaint I have is the fact that the heavy sniper has a attachment rail on it, but it can’t hold any. I would really like if you could add a attachable scope exclusive to the heavy sniper, or to only the weapons take take the heavy bullets (heavy sniper is the only one that takes it own ammo size at the point of writing this, if you have added the scope, thanks!) A weapon I think you could add would be a guided missle, but it would be very expensive, and only one could be spawned at a single time in any server. </h4></td>
