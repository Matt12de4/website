	<td class="middletext" width="225px"><h4>Haven't played the Horizon series since 2 because I've only had a PS4 until recently. Bought a Series S and this was the first game I downloaded because of how much I loved Horizon 2. This is one of the strongest racing games I've ever played. The car list is fantastic, it's far more expansive than games like NFS or Gran Turismo and offers way more oddball cars that are just cool than any other franchise. The map is fun, with plenty of environments and roads that compliment a driving game. Offroading is just as strong as tarmac racing and both are incredibly fun. The driving mechanics are smooth and easy to learn, but still offers a learning curve to truly be fast and drift with success. Graphics are the best I've ever seen. </h4></td>

<td class="lefttext" width="225px"><h4>This game is so incredibly fluid. The controls make it easy to bounce around the battlefield and destroy demons every step of the way. It's easy to change between weapons, use equipment, and chain together attacks to wipe out the demon hordes. The bosses are challenging, the secrets are fun to find, and slayer gates provide a unique challenge with a promise of reward upon the completion of them all. The only downside that I found is how intense it can be. It's a game that I enjoyed playing for a couple of hours, taking a break, and coming back to, as opposed to grinding it all out in one take. That's just personal preference of a casual gamer though, your experience may differ. 9/10</h4></td></table>

	<h4 class="text1">Forza Horizon 5 is wonderfully welcoming, featuring instantly intuitive controls and a collection of cinematic events and activities bound to drop the jaws of both racing rookies and seasoned gearheads. Whether you're drifting around dirt tracks in the jungle, hitting ludicrous speeds on the drag strip, or engaging in wild one-off events racing against airplanes and people in wingsuits </h4>

	<h4 class="text1">This game has the same gameplay mechanics as other games of the franchise and uses these to great effect. In this game you play as the “Slayer” who is tasked with cleansing earth of the demons from hell who have taken control. It is a very high impact and quite violent first person shooter that moves fluidly and has a great sense of progression. Another thing that I would like to lightly touch on is the sound track.</h4>
