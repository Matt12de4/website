A lot of people are COMPLAINING about the new update showing the surroundings in the location of Little Rock! I don’t know why people are so pressed, i like when the new updates come out because i can see a different map/scenery of the game while playing. Like seeing different colored trains, different buildings, etc. Because I don’t like seeing the same thing forever, you know? Getting straight back to my point, the update is fine. I saw this one review saying it looked like a kid drew it out. I was reading and comparing to the actual update and I did NOT agree! </h4></td>

The missions keep me hooked as well trying to beat my record (Which is pretty hard for me!) Coins are SUPER easy to obtain so you don’t have to spend hours trying to get that flashy Outfit or Jetpack you want (I’m look looking at you Gold Plated Sharkhead).

Second, days, why do I have to wait in order to build a railroad? It’s not like it hasn’t been around for the past 100 years. The game truly is very good and well, but, things have to be able to happen faster.
