During my entire playthrough, what astonished me the most was the story. Every step of the way, I found myself stunned, appalled, excited, and even anxious, which made me ponder even more about what was coming next. Even minor pieces of lore, scattered across the map, provided a lot of insight into the story at large.</h4></td></table>
