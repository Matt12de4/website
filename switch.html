The art style is awesome. It is kind of like the Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle art style. The courses and battle courses are really fancy. Because they are either newly shortcut created ones like Mt.Wario or Dolphin shores and the rest of the game is cool. Even the battle modes. I also how some courses are like different game series places like Luigi´s Mansion, The Hyrule kingdom, and much more.What i find the best about the game is the amount of maps and character and what friendly people you can find and stuff like that you know.</h4></td>

This is a completely different Pokémon game compared to all the others where are you pretty much have to battle all the gyms and beat this one difficult gym leader or a catch a legendary Pokémon and/or battle it. So far the storyline is pretty interesting and the fact that each Pokémon a while has different characteristics i.e. they could be either very timid or very violent which actually gives you a challenge to either battle them or A challenge to actually catch them! </h4></td>

It looks like it's going to be cheesy and childish, but it turns out that I actually find the little ring guy encouraging and motivating - he's like a extremely happy personal trainer. This game has me doing dozens of squats and planks a week, and I abhor squats and planks. But something about it makes me choose the skills that are hard for me, and I feel so rewarded when I finish. It's a surprisingly decent RPG when you consider it's predecessor was Wii Fit which had zero plot.</h4></td></table>

	<h4 class="text1">This game is amazing! I recommend it to almost anybody. Because even if you are more of a beginner and not as good at video games you can still have chance to win with smart steering. It won't let you go off the track, kinda like invisible guardrails. The game is phenomenal with the new tracks. It has so many of them. Then the characters there are so many of them.</h4>
