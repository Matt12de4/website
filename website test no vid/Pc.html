<td class="lefttext" width="225px"><h4>This is my first time playing Skyrim so my review will be from the perspective of someone who has not played.
    I love this game so much. If you are like me and have not played Skyrim or any Elder scrolls game yet this is a MUST BUY. This is up there with Witcher 3 in terms of content that is in the game. There is so much to do and so many different play styles as well as endless gear to obtain. I'm currently level 40 and still haven't even scratched the surface of the amount of content the game has to offer.
   I can see why people who have played Skyrim's older editions would not like it though. Elder scrolls 6 is probably more for what they are looking for. So I can't recommend it if you fall into that category. </h4></td></table>

	<h4 class="text1">The new update is wonderful for anyone wanting a challenge. It's fun and it gives me chills and flushing the baby down the toilet is funny. I've seen videos about it but the white rabbit definitely drew me in and I can't even beat it, I'll figure it out soon, I'm just not fast enough. It's really cool.</h4>
